#NEUTRINO
##Introduction
Being forced to work to other people is probably the most challanging part of live. I do not want to count those sociopaths who strive in the society by manipulation and desceit. And, there are other types of 'know-it-all' lads who think that their opinion is the only opinion that matters. Brief episodes of employment and numerous fruitless job interviews have led me to realize that I do not need any of them to prove to myself that I am a decent programmer. I have decided to take on a play project - Neutrino: de-centralized smart contract crypto promissory note. I want you to dwell on the idea for a bit and how practical it can be to de-couple ourselves from banks and the system in general. The truth is - they need us to exist, we, on the other hand, do not need them to live and thrive.

I am still thinking about all possible use cases, but the general idea is soverign asset/debt ratios expressed as smart contracts with the ability to buy, sell, trade assets/debts using de-cetralized smart contract crypto promissory notes.

## Technologies
With this project I am pursuing a number of goals, one of which is the ultra high performance of crypto transaction processing. Crypto signing/verification is a very expensive process and I would like to find the most effecient way to use a crypto solution to sing and verify transactions really really fast. I want the soluiton to be near real time as close as possible, so any programming language with any type of vm or runtime engine is simply not acceptable. I want the solution to be reliable so any memory bug prone languages are to be left out of the equation. What am I left with? Rust! What do I choose for the front end so that anyone can have access to the technology - a mobile app, a desktop app, a web app. Is there a technology that would allow me to write once and deploy to all the mediums? Flutter? Why not!

So, what would I like to start using for the project: Rust, Flutter/Dart

As I slowly progress through the project I will publish my thoughts, research findings, evolving understanding of the decetralized financing, the inner workings of Rust, Flutter/Dart.

Let the fun begin! After all, this project's main objectives are fun, learning, playing with Rust, Flutter/Dart in order to build a de-centralized smart crypto promissory note solution to use in my personal financing.
